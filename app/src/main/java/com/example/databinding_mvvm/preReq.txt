Basics : Recycler view will provide multiple row layout

Given :
#Data source - it contains multiple object with data inside those object
#XML Single Row Design

Structure :
1) we will have a Single Row Design of XML
2) Adaptor class :  Consist of "onCreate(),onBind()" Method and "ViewHolder" class.

        1) @onCreate : It will create the View when the code is running (Run-time).
                      ie. we have onCreate() method in activity which will make view
                      in runtime, also it setContentView() method which attaches the view.

        2) @onBind   : It will merge the Data in the view which was created by the onCreate()
                       method.
        3) class ViewHolder :
                       It will take the reference (ie. findViewById of the View and attach the view)
                       of the XML design and attach it will the Code.
